# Parameters below can be overriden by command line (has priority).
# Default values are commented out.
# All boolean values can be 1/True or 0/False/(empty).

## BASIC CONFIGURATION
backup:

  # Name
  # Backup job name
  name: Sample

  # Backup Type
  # Possible values: tar, rsync
  # Specify the backup method
  type: tar

  # Frequency
  # Possible values: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
  # Specify the backup frequency
  # If tar, the date is appended to the filename and it only runs once per period
  # If rsync+incremental, the date is used in the backup folder name
  #frequency: daily

  # Incremental
  # Possible values: boolean
  # Specify whether the backup is incremental or not (full).
  # If tar incremental then increment period is *month* (every month one full backup).
  # Then checks if snar is in this month or delete.
  # If rsync then it is backwards incremental.
  incremental: True

  # Full backup frequency
  # Possible values: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
  # Specify how often a full backup will be performed (tar incremental only)
  # If ommited, it will never reperform a full backup
  #full_backup_frequency: monthly

  # Ignore existing
  # Possible values: boolean
  # Ignores existing files on destination (rsync only).
  #ignore_existing:


  # MySQL Dump
  # Possible values: boolean
  # Run a mysqldump before the backup.
  # Make sure to have properly configured ~/.my.cnf
  # See destination-database
  #
  #mysqldump: False

  # PostGreSQL Dump
  # Possible values: boolean
  # Run a pgdump before the backup.
  # Make sure to have properly configured ~/.pgpass
  # See destination-database
  #
  #postgresdump: False

  # Directories
  # Which directories to include.
  # Separate with comma (tar only).
  #
  directories:
    - /etc

  # Excludes
  # Which files or directories to exclude.
  #
  excludes:
    - Thumbs.db
    - .BridgeCacheT
    - .BridgeCache
    - .BridgeCachet
    - .BridgeLabelsAndRatings
    - .AppleDouble
    - .DS_Store
    - ._.DS_Store
    - .TemporaryItems
    - .apdisk
    - desktop.ini


## DESTINATION CONFIGURATION
destination:

  # Destination
  # Where to place backup files.
  #
  destination: /tmp

  # Destination Type
  # Possible values: local, ssh, usb, (in future: ftp)
  # Specify type of backup destination.
  # Useful for second media / cloud.
  #
  type: local

  # Device
  # If usb, it is the device to be mounted (eg /dev/sdd1)
  # Not used for ssh. Blkid not yet supported.
  # Set device even if local backup to get report of free disk space.
  #
  #device:

  # Encrypted key
  # If encrypted usb, set to pathfilename of keyfile.
  # Otherwise leave empty.
  #
  #encrypted_key:

  # Encrypted mappoint
  # If encrypted usb, set to mappoint.
  # Otherwise leave empty.
  # Usually the same as leaf directory of target mountpoint.
  #
  #encrypted_map:

  # Incremental Backup Directory
  # Where to keep incremental backups (rsync only).
  # Prefer absolute paths to avoid backup loops.
  #
  #backup_dir:

  # Database destination
  # Specify where to output database dumps (if enabled)
  # If ommited then general destination will be used.
  #
  #database:

  ## PURGE CONFIGURATION
  # Local Quota
  # Possible values: integer
  # Up to which size to allow old backups (in GB).
  # Leave empty or put a very large number to disable.
  # If after the backup is completed, the size of all backups are larger than quota, then:
  # 1. The old backups are logarithmically purged:
  #  * If incremental off, then snar=1st backup of month
  #  If incremental on, then all backup files to be deleted need be snar files (or all full backups to be snar anyway)
  #  It will clean all but first file for each month of current year (except for current month)
  #  It will clean all but first file for 1, 4, 7, 10 of previous year
  #  It will clean all but first file for 1 of 2nd-previous year and back
  # 2. If still larger, then old backups are cleared in order.
